Salted Caramel Latte

Ingredients
1 tablespoon salted caramel sauce
4 ounces hot milk
2 ounces espresso coffee
For Topping: Whipped Cream Caramel Sauce

Instructions
Place the caramel sauce in a serving glass. (I like to drizzle it down the sides.)
Prepare the steamed milk and carefully add to the serving glass. Add in brewed espresso.
Alternatively, used the Deâ€™Longhi Eletta Cappuccino machine on the Cafe Latte Setting. Simply place the caramel in the cup and press the button!
Top with whipped cream and caramel sauce and serve warm.
